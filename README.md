# 09 Node.js Challenge: Professional README Generator

## My Task

I will create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows me or any project creator to devote more time to working on the project.

My task is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4). Review the [Professional README Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide) as a reminder of everything that a high-quality, professional README should contain. 

The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

Because this application won’t be deployed, I will provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality. I reviewed Screencastify Tutorial in the prework as a refresher on how to record video from your computer. I have added this link to youtube. Please view the following youtube link for my recording:<br>

## Acceptance Criteria
